          My mission was the best two years up to my life up until this point, and I made friends and memories that I will never forget. The areas that God placed me in truly shape me even more who I am today.  Here are my top 3 favorite areas I was able to pass through!

                    <ul>
                        <li>I spent 5 months with 3 different companions trecking up and down the hills of San Antonio. With around a year in the mission, here my spanish really started to take off. I also learned the importance of building connections with the local members to further the work.

                                   Fun fact: San Antonio Chile is known for having the biggest port in South America. We also lived in the highest tower in San Antonio on the top floor, our apartment window looked right out on the ocean and the port! The video down below will tell you everything you need to know about that. in addition to "Las tomas". Essentially where people find a spot of land and build a house. It's not legal, but now San Antonio is home to thousands (and thousands) of people that live on the tomas. A lot of immigrants live their for the cheap housing, but in addition many Santiaginos build second houses there for when they come to vacation. The picture right below is where we would spend the majority of our procelyting time.

                <h5 id="Diego">Diego de Almagro</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Some might call it the promise land. If you look up central Santiago on a map, this area will appear right under it. The streets streamed with vendors selling perros calientes, arrepas, chicha a la maracucha, empanadas, you name it. Proselyting there never got boring. There were literally thousands of people to talk to in every moment of every day. You had to learn to work smart instead of just being busy. Reading Preach my Gospel was crucial in staying on top and taking care of business there.

                                    Fun Fact: In this specific part of town, around a square mile around Parque Almagro, there are way more Venezuelen and Peruvian immigrants than Chilean people. Chile is probably the safest/economically sound country in South America, so everyone flocks there from their broken homelands.

                            Right outside of the big city, we were in the "suburbs" of Santiago. This was also known as the best ward in the mission. We were loved by all of the members and they treated us so well. There were also 12 active, recently returned missionaries that would always accompany us. They were hilarious and would always make the friends feel at home.

                                    Fun Fact: In this area I was able to be companions with one of my cousins! We were called to the same mission but never really expected that we would be put together, let alone for three months! This was one of my favorite parts of my mission. We worked hard, and we were able to see a lot of success.
